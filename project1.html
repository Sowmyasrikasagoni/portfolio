    <h1>Dry Eye Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      This project focuses on analyzing a large clinical dataset to detect Dry Eye Syndrome using machine learning.
      The dataset contained over 20,000 patient entries with various symptoms and diagnostic values. After preprocessing
      (missing values, encoding, normalization), models like Random Forest, SVM, and LightGBM were trained and evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key metrics like accuracy, precision, ROC curve, and F1-score were visualized. The Random Forest model achieved around
      72% accuracy. Feature importance plots helped identify key clinical indicators contributing to dry eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
