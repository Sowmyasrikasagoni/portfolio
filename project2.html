    <h1>Skin Cancer Detection using CNN + LSTM</h1>
    <p>
      This deep learning project leverages a hybrid CNN + LSTM model to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant.
      The dataset used was HAM10000, containing thousands of high-resolution dermoscopic images. 
      Image preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization were applied before feeding into the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hybrid architecture achieved 97% validation accuracy. xLSTM was also tested and showed better generalization 
      and convergence. Visualization tools like confusion matrix and learning curves supported model evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, LSTM, Matplotlib
