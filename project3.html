    <h1>PhonePe Homepage Clone</h1>
    <p>
      The PhonePe Homepage Clone is a fully static frontend project that replicates the visual design and layout of the original PhonePe website using only HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze a real-world product interface and translate it into clean, responsive code. The clone features a fixed navigation bar with logo and menu links, a sliding banner carousel implemented using radio buttons and CSS transitions, and an interactive section showcasing services like investment, insurance, and lending. Each of these service cards includes hover animations, modern box shadows, and animated arrows to mimic real UI behaviors seen in production websites.

The slider is built without JavaScript — using only input selectors, pseudo-classes, and transition effects, ensuring maximum performance and responsiveness. I’ve also incorporated responsive design principles using Flexbox and percentage-based layouts, allowing the site to adapt smoothly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Transitions and transform properties have been used to animate UI components, while sticky navigation ensures user engagement and brand consistency as users scroll.

This project was aimed at enhancing my frontend development skills, particularly in component structuring, layout design, and responsive user interfaces. It reflects my attention to detail, pixel-perfect design reproduction, and the ability to structure HTML elements semantically. The PhonePe Clone serves as a foundational showcase in my portfolio for mastering frontend principles without any frameworks or external libraries.
