    <h1>Placement Prediction Using ML</h1>
    <p>
      Designed a machine learning model to predict the placement status of students based on various academic and skill-based features.
      Dataset included SSC, HSC, degree percentage, internship experience, and soft skills. 
      Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests were trained and evaluated.
      The best model achieved an accuracy of ~83%.
    </p>
    <p>Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib</p>
